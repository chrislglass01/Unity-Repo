# Unity-Repo

It starts here!!!!
I'm a network analyst and love to fix/troubleshoot but my true passion is creativity! I've built projects in Unity and interactive electronics with Arduino microcontrollers. I've worked with C#, Java, and Javascript in school and as a hobbyist. I hope to transition my career from IT to coding. It's certaintly satisfying to fix a problem, but nothing beats the feeling I get when I see something come alive that I was involved in or responsible for. Here we go!
